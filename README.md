# BSOD-Trigger
When this application is run on windows, it causes a blue screen of death.

The app sets itsself as a required process and exits right after,
thus windows crashes with error code: Critical Process Died.

Just download the /bin folder and execute the .exe file. (Admin permission needed)
The executable needs all files in /bin to be in the same folder.(Dont move the exe file to another folder alone)
