# BSOD-Trigger
When this application is run on windows, it causes a blue screen of death.

The app sets itsself as a required process and exits right after,
thus windows crashes with error code: Critical Process Died.

Just download the bin folder and execute the .exe file. (Admin permission needed)
All the other files are required to be in the same folder as the executable.
